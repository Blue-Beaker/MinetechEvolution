**Before opening the issue**
- [ ] I've tested the optimization in my modpack instance.  
- [ ] The optimization gives significant improvement(for performance optimizations at least ~10%).  
- [ ] The optimization does not have incompatibility with any common platforms (Win/mac/linux, Intel/AMD CPUs, Intel/AMD/Nvidia GPUs)  
**The optimization**
Please explain your optimization of mods changed, config changed... here. Split your optimization into multiple individually functional groups if available.  
**Effects**
Replace this with what the optimization does.  
**Side Effects**
Any side-effects should be stated here, including feature/behaviour changes, config-file replacement, negative impact on performance/stability etc.  
**Test Results**
Test your optimized modpack and the original modpack, then post the comparison results here. OS/hardware info are recommended to have here as well.
